# Reinforcement-Learning

Some basic implementations of Reinforcement learning algorithms ( Bandit, Q-Learning, Sarsa) .
The problem statements are given in the pdfs, and their solutions are given in python ( or notebook ) files. 

In order to see the output it is recommended to make an effort to run these algorithms at a terminal using python3, as it is 
difficult to deduce something from the outputs.
